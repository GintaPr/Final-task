Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor yet bite plants or hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away so Gate keepers of hell snob you for another person and scoot butt on the rug. Hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser stare out cat door then go back inside but destroy dog bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together or touch water with paw then recoil in horror but i is not fat, i is fluffy yet ptracy.
